## Usage Examples

### Basic Authentication Flow
1. User signs up → Account created → Navigate to email confirmation
2. User enters verification code → Email verified → Navigate to main app
3. User forgets password → Request reset → Check email → Reset password → Login

### Service Usage
```typescript
// Send verification code
const result = await EmailService.sendVerificationCode('user@example.com');

// Verify email
const verified = await AuthService.verifyEmail('user@example.com', '123456');

// Reset password request
const reset = await AuthService.resetPassword('user@example.com');
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced authentication system provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly experience for user registration, login, and password recovery. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements while maintaining type safety and proper error handling throughout the application.
